## Introduction

This project is a simple e-commerce API designed to manage users, products, orders, and authentication. It is built with the Laravel framework, leveraging JWT for secure authentication. Through this project, I have practiced writing APIs following REST architecture and gained deeper insights into backend development. The project will continue to be updated and improved over time (if I find the time ðŸ˜…), but sure I will do that.

This is the second version of the project with many changes and improvements in authentication, endpoints, methods, and more. All changes are detailed below, and you can view the original project https://github.com/ptduy14/laravel-api.

## New Change
- Added Swagger for API documentation.
- Switched authentication to Sanctum for simpler token issuance without relying on external packages.
- Customized HTTP exceptions.
- Adjusted endpoint URLs for better user-friendliness.
- Fixed bugs in the cart module (update cart).
- Resolved authentication issues.
- Added enums to define order statuses.
